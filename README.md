# pomodoro

Pomodoro timer with MODIFICATION of session time and break time and SOUND notifications. 

The end of the session and the end of the break is indicated by a SOUND, allowing the application to work in the background without having to look behind the clock. To distinguish without looking the end of the session from the end of the break sounds are different. 

(Batman is said to have a similar one).
